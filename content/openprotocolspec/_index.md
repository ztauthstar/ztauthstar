**ZTAuth*** defines an authorization model and a trust model — collectively referred to as `auth* models` — through a protocol-level specification that is:

- **Transferable**
- **Versionable**
- **Immutable**
- **Resilient**

It supports the implementation of `auth* models` aligned with the core principles of Zero Trust, enabling the construction of **Zero Trust security models**.

**ZTAuth*** does not replace existing standards. Instead, it enhances them by adding a dedicated layer for fine-grained, reproducible authorization across both human and non-human identities.

**ZTAuth*** redefines authorization (authz) and trust models — collectively referred to as `auth* models` — using a framework that is:

- **Transferable**
- **Versionable**
- **Immutable**
- **Resilient**

It supports the implementation of **Trust Models** and Zero Trust security.

**ZTAuth*** does not replace existing standards. Instead, it enhances them by adding a dedicated layer for fine-grained, reproducible authorization across both human and non-human identities.

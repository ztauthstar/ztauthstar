In **ZTAuth\***, decision points consist of a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) and a Policy Decision Point (PDP) that together handle authorization requests.  

Communication between the PEP and PDP is designed to comply with the [OpenID AuthZen](https://openid.net/specs/authorization-api-1_0-01.html) specification.

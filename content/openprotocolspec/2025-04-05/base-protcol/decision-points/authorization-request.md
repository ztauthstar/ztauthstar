The `Authorization Request` is a fundamental element of the **ZTAuth\*** protocol. It represents the interaction between the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) and the Policy Decision Point (PDP), through which the PDP evaluates authorization decisions based on defined authorization models (`auth* models`) and contextual information.

The payload structure is based on the format defined in the [OpenID AuthZEN specification](https://openid.net/specs/authorization-api-1_0-01.html), allowing compatibility with existing authorization flows and interfaces.

To support Zero Trustâ€“oriented evaluation, the ZTAuth\* protocol extends the request format with an additional field named `authorization_model`. This object carries contextual information necessary for advanced policy evaluation and may include the following fields:

- `zone_id`: An identifier representing the [Zero Trust Zone (ztzone)](/openprotocolspec/2025-04-05/base-protcol/domains-zones/#ztzone) associated with the request.
- `ledger_id`: A reference to the specific ledger or model repository where the relevant authorization policies are stored.
- `tx_token`: A transaction token generated by the Transaction Token Service, encapsulating context such as identity, delegation, and scope.

These fields are intended as an illustrative example of how the `authorization_model` structure can be extended to carry ZTAuth\*-specific data. Implementations may vary in structure or naming, depending on system requirements and deployment context.

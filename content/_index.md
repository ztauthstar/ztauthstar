title: Zero Trust Auth*
---
Welcome to the official **Zero Trust Auth\*** (`ZTAuth*`) open protocol specification.

> **ZTAuth\*** is a Zero Trust compliant open protocol that provides secure, identity-driven access to resources, enforcing least privilege at the application edge. Designed for eventual consistency, it maintains the security state during network disruptions and automatically synchronizes when connectivity is restored.

Pronounce it `Zee-Tee-Auth-Star`. The `star` is a wildcard, hinting at extras like `trusted elevation` or `delegation`.

For short, use `ZTAStar` (`Zee-Tee-Ei-Star`).

**ZTAuth\*** does not replace existing standards. It adds a separate layer for fine-grained and repeatable authorization, supporting both human and non-human identities, and meeting Zero Trust security requirements.

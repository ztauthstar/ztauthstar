title: Zero Trust Auth*
---
Welcome to the official **Zero Trust Auth\*** (`ZTAuth*`) open protocol specification.

> **ZTAuth\*** is a Zero Trust compliant protocol for secure, identity-based access at the application edge. It supports eventual consistency and resilient synchronization across network disruptions. Built with a delegation-first model, it is ideal for systems that require secure and auditable delegation.

Pronounce it `Zee-Tee-Auth-Star`. The `star` is a wildcard, hinting at extras like `trusted elevation` or `delegation`.

For short, use `ZTAStar` (`Zee-Tee-Ei-Star`).

**ZTAuth\*** does not replace existing standards. It adds a separate layer for fine-grained and repeatable authorization, supporting both human and non-human identities, and meeting `Zero Trust` security requirements.

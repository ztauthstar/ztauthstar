# ZTAuth*: Zero Trust AuthZ and Trust Models

**ZTAuth*** defines an authorization model and a trust model — collectively referred to as `auth* models` — through a protocol-level specification that is:

- **Transferable**
- **Versionable**
- **Immutable**
- **Resilient**

This protocol is designed in alignment with Zero Trust principles, supporting the creation of security models that are identity-aware, context-sensitive, and enforce least privilege by default.

**ZTAuth*** does not replace existing standards. Instead, it enhances them by adding a dedicated layer for fine-grained, reproducible authorization across both human and non-human identities.

> The purpose of this repository is to collect and maintain implementations of the specifications related to the ZTAuth* Open Protocol.
